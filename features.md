## Feature Roadmap
#### 1. Bill of Materials (BOM)
Having a common source of information across your company is incredibly important during product development. At the very least, our system should provide a single definition of a particular product and its components.  
More advanced options include features specifically designed for different team members such as designers, engineers and other professionals who frequently collaborate.  

- [ ] BOM Management (reference to the product)
- [ ] Drill-Down (navigating through a system or database to view more detailed information)
- [ ] Alerte for low storage in function of the usage of the factories/outlets

#### 2. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Tools and Management
This accessory helps product designers and engineers map out and construct 2D and 3D models of commodities on a computer instead of doing it all on paper.

- [ ] Variant/Versionning Recepe Management
- [ ] Raw material needs estimation
- [ ] Documentation process
- [ ] Cost analysis of the product
- [ ] CAD Solidwork repos

#### 3. Quote Process Management

You need data from many different sources during the quote process. PLM’s inherent coordination capabilities gather and organize data for product design to support your engineering teams. This appliance includes teams developing engineer-to-order and configure-to-order products.  
The system only shares the necessary data, meaning your team members can spend more time focusing on their work and less on hunting down information. A quote process management module also helps streamline your teams’ collaborative efforts.  
Additionally, quote process management includes tools to help users determine the cost of a schedule. Users can employ the system to gather PLM requirements and seek out the most competitive quotes.

- [ ] Cost of Schedule
- [ ] Automatic Work Order Creation
- [ ] Requirements Gathering
- [ ] Configure-to-Order
- [ ] Engineer-to-Order

#### 4. User Access Levels

- [ ] Role and Group Hierarchy
- [ ] Role-Based Access
- [ ] Administrative Controls
